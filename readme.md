# GSWAT-Node

This is a port of the ASP.NET MVC (C#) based GSWAT Battlefield Server Administration tool to Node.js - all credit goes to the PureBattlefield Developers.

### Installation
***

* Install Node.js
* Navigate to the gswat-node directory in a shell and run `npm install` to grab the dependencies.
* Modify the config/gswat-config.js file to reflect your server credentials (temporary).
* Start gswat-node by running `node app.js`


To avoid conflicts gswat-node runs on Port 3000 by default, you can change this in the app.js file or by setting a PORT property for your corresponding environment in the config/config.js file.

Enjoy!
